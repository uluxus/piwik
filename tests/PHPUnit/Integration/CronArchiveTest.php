NOTES
- If you execute this script at least once per hour (or more often) in a crontab, you may disable 'Browser trigger archiving' in Matomo UI > Settings > General Settings.
  See the doc at: https://matomo.org/docs/setup-auto-archiving/
- Async process archiving supported, using CliMulti.
- Reports for today will be processed at most every 900 seconds. You can change this value in Matomo UI > Settings > General Settings.
- Limiting segment archiving to following segments:
  * actions>=2;browserCode=FF
  * actions>=2
